What Are Several Useful Keyboard Shortcuts for Maximizing Productivity in VS Code?
-You're likely already familiar with some of the basic shortcuts, which are inherited from your operating system. Shortcuts like Ctrl + S to save, Ctrl + C to copy, and Ctrl + V to paste all work in VS Code.

-Shift + Alt + F will run your configured formatter (such as prettier, for a JavaScript project) on the currently opened file.

-Ctrl + Shift + F (Windows), or Cmd + Shift + F (Mac), to search the text contents of all the files in your workspace. Then Ctrl + Shift + H (Windows), or Cmd + Shift + H (Mac), if you want to run a find-and-replace.

-If you need to remove a line, Ctrl + Shift + K (Windows), or Cmd + Shift + K (Mac), will delete it.

-Ctrl + B (Windows), or Cmd + B (Mac), will hide the sidebar - which has the file list and extensions menu.

-Ctrl + plus (Windows), or Cmd + plus (Mac), will increase the scaling of the editor, and Ctrl + minus (Windows), or Cmd + minus (Mac), will decrease it.

-you can place multiple cursors by using Ctrl + Alt + down and Ctrl + Alt + up (Windows/Linux), or Option + Command + down and Option + Command + up (Mac), to extend the cursor to consecutive lines. You can also press and hold Alt (Windows/Linux) or Option (Mac) and click to add cursors on separate lines wherever you need them. Once the cursors are placed, anything you type or delete will apply to all those locations simultaneously — which can save a lot of time when working with repetitive code.

-Ctrl + Shift + P (Windows), or Cmd + Shift + P (Mac), which opens the command palette for you to select whatever you may need.
