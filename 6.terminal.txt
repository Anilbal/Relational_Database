What is Terminal?
-A terminal is a special application that offers a command line interface to perform system-level commands beyond the basic read/write operations. You may also hear about "terminal emulators", which are essentially applications that wrap a basic terminal interface to offer additional features or functionality. But for most general purposes, you are probably safe to refer to these as "terminals" as well.
